# Flashcard-Continued
This is part of Codepath's 4th week assignment. We are passing data

## Lab 2

### App Description
`This app displays a add button that allows the user to create a flash card. The user can enter the question and answer of 
thier flashcard. They can either cancel if they decide not to use the card or click the "Done" button. 

I did not complete optional 4 that included having multipe choice answers. However, I did managed to show an error message and edit the flashcard.
